This project makes use of Parcel and Netlify's Continuous Deployment
Maybe this is like using a rocket launcher to kill flies considering it's a very simple project but it's a start.

The architectural pattern I used for this project is called **spaguetti** ðŸ˜”ðŸ‘Œ

Anyways, that's not the point, I was just trying to use CI with Netlify and Bundling with Parcel so I started coding right away without much planning.
